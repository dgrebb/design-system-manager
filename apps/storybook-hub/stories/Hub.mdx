# Theme Lab Hub

Welcome to the **Theme Lab Hub** — a composition of multiple Storybook instances.

## Connected Storybooks

### Theme Lab
The core component library with design tokens and web components.
- **URL:** http://localhost:6006
- **Contents:** Button, Input, and more components

### Adapters (Coming Soon)
Integration adapters for popular UI libraries:
- shadcn-svelte
- Nuxt UI
- And more...

## How Composition Works

Storybook Composition allows you to browse multiple Storybook instances from a single hub. Each connected Storybook appears in the sidebar and loads its stories dynamically.

### Starting the Hub

```bash
# Start the main theme-lab storybook first
bun run dev

# In another terminal, start the hub
bun run dev:hub
```

### Adding a New Storybook Ref

Edit `.storybook/main.ts` to add new refs:

```typescript
refs: {
  'theme-lab': {
    title: 'Theme Lab',
    url: 'http://localhost:6006',
  },
  'new-adapter': {
    title: 'New Adapter',
    url: 'http://localhost:6007',
  },
},
```

## Base Library Selector

(Coming in Milestone 4)

A toolbar addon will allow you to:
- Filter visible storybooks
- Switch between library contexts
- Compare components across libraries
